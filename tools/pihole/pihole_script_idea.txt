1. Script that calculates the overlapping domains from a list compared to the database (in percent)

The given domain list overlaps to 4 % with the database (5/3462 domains)

List endpoint? --> get all lists
then download lists, combine into one list and compare with given list
OR execute script on pihole device and get lists directly via /etc/pihole/listsCache (is there another place where lists are saved?)

is there an easy way to get total number of domains in database? (metrics or ftl endpoint?)
compare length of all lists with total number in database?

differentiate allow/block list?
filter for enabled/disabled?
handle exact/regex?

User input - Address of the list you want to add: X - Type of list: Allow/Block

2. Script that outputs the number of duplicates in the database

3. Script that updates the adlists from sefinek (adlists all need to be removed and readded in case a whole new list was added)

4. Create group which does not block anything and then add script for moving clients to this group or away from this group

5. SIEM: check if new devices connected to the network (to the pi.hole)

pi.network.get_devices(), then check regularly if any new devices are in the list
